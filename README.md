Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abhishek, an assistive technology enthusiast and researcher with 3+ years of experience working with visually impaired students. I graduated with my Ph.D. from Auburn University in the Summer of 2022. My current research is in the areas of using natural language processing to help visually impaired students learn mathematics.
